<h1>Our Really exicting game</h1>
<h2> Our game design</h2>
Me and my teamate Tanay, decided to work on the first level of Mr. Motensons rpg game. We have a total of 2 npc and one hero charecter. Our game idea was that the charecter would be walking around in a scyber-punk destopian setting. Their would be a total of 5 quetion all over the page with the npc's and in different foods. When you are done with the quetion about me Aarav Lohiya and Tanay Oliwar, you will get a food. When you colect the 5 foods we feed it to the fat guy, and after you give the fat guy all of the foods you will go to the next level the platformer game.
