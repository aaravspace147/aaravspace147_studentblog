<h1>Our Really exicting game</h1>
<h2> Our game design</h2>
Me and my teamate Tanay, decided to work on the first level of Mr. Motensons rpg game. We have a total of 3 npc and one hero charecter. Our game idea was that the charecter would be walking around in a scyber-punk destopian setting. Their would be a total of 5 quetion all over the page with the npc's and in different foods. When you are done with the quetion about me Aarav Lohiya and Tanay Oliwar, you will get a food. When you colect the 5 foods we feed it to the fat guy, and after you give the fat guy all of the foods you will go to the next level the platformer game. 
<h2> Sprites </h2>

<h3> The Fat Guy </h3>

The fat guy is one of the npc of out game. He is the one who we need to feed all of the 5 foods, so you could move on to the next level. 

<h3> The Hero Aarav Lohiya </h3>

The hero aarav is a brave man aiming to finish the game. He is the player you will be playing with and will be the ome to collect the 5 foods.
